# Four-Qubit-Quantum-Chip-Analysis
I designed a 4-qubit superconducting chip using Qiskit Metal and performed analyses including Energy Participation Ratio, Capacitive, and S-parameter assessments. Using Ansys HFSS and Q3D Extractor, I optimized the chipâ€™s performance, analyzing energy distribution, capacitance, and signal behavior for improved quantum computing efficiency.
